## Acknowledgements

Code found in this repository was originally drawn from [LifeLonger](https://github.com/mmderakhshani/LifeLonger) repository, which was also taken from [FACIL](https://github.com/mmasana/FACIL). FACIL provides a useful framework to implement and test class-incremental learning strategies.

The basis of this code is made possible by [Athan Zhang](https://github.com/athanzxyt), his mentors at George Mason Univserity Dr. Mingrui Liu and Michael Crawshaw, as well as his colleagues Anant Khandelwal and Alex Li.
